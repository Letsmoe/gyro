# 'awd' Documentation
This is the index page for the documentation of your new package.
What you're looking at right now is `mpp` or `markdown++`, a flavor of Markdown that has Gyro embedded as a templating language in it.

{%
table = toc("Table of Contents");
%}
{{table}}

## Why mpp?
We developed mpp to simplify the process of documenting our project. Look at the example above, you can easily create a Table of Contents with just a line of code rather than having to type it manually every time you want to update.
There is also the possibility of embedding other files into your documentation. The inclusion of modules into your project and automatic documentation generation of your codebase by using the `docGenerate("<filename>", "<optional_language>")` command.

## Development Experience
An official `mpp` syntax highlighting extension is available for VSCode [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Letsmoe.mpp).
